Code and data for manuscript and project about bees without flowers: honeydew foraging

Project abstract:
Bee foragers respond to complex visual, olfactory, and extrasensory cues to optimize searches for floral rewards. 
They can detect, distinguish, and remember floral colors, markings, shapes, volatiles, and ultraviolet signals, and even gauge nectar reward from changes in floral humidity or electric fields. 
Bee foraging behaviors in the absence of floral cues, however, are not well understood. 
We observed fifty species of wild bees visiting inconspicuous, non-flowering shrubs during early bloom season in a protected, Mediterranean habitat. 
We determined experimentally that these bees were accessing sugary honeydew secretions from scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea), and were doing so without the aid of standard floral cues. 
While honeydew is important in mutualistic associations between honeydew producers and ants, and isolated accounts have documented its use by social bee species, honeydew use across a community of solitary bees is a novel observation. 
The widespread ability of diverse native bees to locate and use unadvertised, non-floral sugars suggests the existence of sensory mechanisms and foraging dynamics more complex and interconnected than has previously been understood.


Data for this project were collected at Pinnacles National Park in California in Spring of 2012.
We are currently in the process of submitting the manuscript for publication.  
Authors: Joan Meiners, Terry Griswold, and Morgan Ernest.
Code and data will be stored here.  Data will also be deposited at the Dryad Digital Repository at datadryad.org
